# maize_subgenomes

This respository stores scripts used in Renny-Byfield, Rosgers-Melnick and Ross-Ibarra 2016. The analysis are detailed for the most part in several scripts, details of which are provided below.

The analysis uses genotype and phenotype data from the HapMap3 and [Panzea]("http://www.panzea.org/") consortia. Analysis relies heavily on RStudio, [TASSEL5]("http://www.maizegenetics.net/#!tassel/c17q9") and a number of R packages, particularly GenomicRanges and ggplot2.
