# maize_subgenomes

This respository stores scripts used in Renny-Byfield, Rosgers-Melnick and Ross-Ibarra 2016. 

The scripts deposited here are for illustrative purposes only, and are not intended to provide a working data analysis pipeline for others wishing to perform similar analysis. The scripts are provided as a transparent description of the code we used during the analyses, and are unlikely to work "out of the box" on any other machine. As such copying and use of these scripts comes with absolutely no warranty of any kind. However, we hope that others can use this as a base from which to develop their own code and analyses.  

The analysis uses genotype and phenotype data from the HapMap3 and [Panzea](http://www.panzea.org/) consortia and previously published [sub-genome designations](http://www.pnas.org/content/108/10/4069). Analysis relies heavily on RStudio, [TASSEL5](http://www.maizegenetics.net/#!tassel/c17q9) and a number of R packages, particularly GenomicRanges and ggplot2.
