This respository stores scripts used in Renny-Byfield, Rosgers-Melnick and Ross-Ibarra 2016. The analysis are detailed for the most part in several scripts, details of which are provided below.

The scripts deposited here are for illustrative purposes only, and are not intended to provide a working data analysis pipeline for other wishing to perform similar analysis. The scripts are meant to provide a transparent description of the code we used during the analysis, and are unlikely to work out of the box on any other machine. As such copying and use of these scripts comes with absolutely no warranty of any kind.  

The analysis uses genotype and phenotype data from the HapMap3 and [Panzea]("http://www.panzea.org/") consortia. Analysis relies heavily on RStudio, [TASSEL5]("http://www.maizegenetics.net/#!tassel/c17q9") and a number of R packages, particularly GenomicRanges and ggplot2.
